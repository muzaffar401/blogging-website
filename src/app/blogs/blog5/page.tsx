                        The evolution of the auto industry is similar in form to the currently nascent world of artificial intelligence (AI). And like the auto industry, in order for AI to flourish, organizations must adopt and embrace a prerequisite set of conditions, or building blocks.

                        For example, AI requires machine learning; machine learning requires analytics; and analytics requires the right data and information architecture. In other words, there is no AI without IA (information architecture). These capabilities form the solid rungs of what we call the AI Ladder â€“ the increasing levels of analytic sophistication that lead to, and buttress, a thriving AI environment.

                        AI is about mimicking and improving the human function; said another way, bringing human features to technology. In the consumer world, that is mimicking speech, vision, and daily interactions. In the enterprise, it is mimicking and improving enterprise functions, such as Logistics, Marketing, Finance, Operations, and HR. While it is similar in concept, the difference is as stark as the Cugnot Steam Trolley and a Tesla.
