                        Since the year 2000, 52% of the companies that make up the Fortune 500 have disappeared. They have been acquired, succumbed to performance atrophy, or declared bankruptcy. In this hyper-competitive marketplace, winners and losers are being declared every day. And while artificial intelligence (AI) can be the valve to these pressures, for many, drafting a playbook for actually winning with AI remains daunting.

                        Also, consider a recent IDC Cloud and AI Adoption Survey[1] in which more than 80% of respondents said they plan to move, or repatriate, data and workloads from public cloud environments to private clouds or on-premises locations over the next year, as the initial expectations of a single public cloud provider were not realized. These dynamics add to the confusion that every CEO, CIO, CTO, and CDO faces on a daily basis.

                    So, what precisely is dragging down projects and preventing companies from delivering measurable business value? I see three recurring patterns:

                        Companies have been accumulating data at an amazing pace for years, but are still challenged with how to store, manage, and control access. They need a new, modern approach;

                    <li>
                        The pressure to innovate is mounting. Companies create a chief data office or a data science center of excellence, but do not always have the right model for organizational success;
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Small successes only scale when models are put into production and companies adapt their business processes, but unfortunately, this doesnâ€™t occur very often. Scale requires platform thinking and technology.
                    </li>
